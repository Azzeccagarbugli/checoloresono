## üëã Introduction
In Italy Regions and Autonomous Provinces are classified into three areas - **red**, **orange**, **yellow** and **white** - corresponding to four risk scenarios, for which specific restrictive measures are foreseen. This web application, made in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), aims to help the user to find in a smarter way this kind of information.

The classification is based on ordinances issued by the [**Ministry of Health**](http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioContenutiNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=english&id=5367&area=nuovoCoronavirus&menu=vuoto).
